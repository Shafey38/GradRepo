  <p style="font-size:15px">The recent deterioration in the Egyptian traffic in general and in the Alexandrian traffic in particular has led to more people than not losing their way around the city especially during critical emergency situations. The proposed software application focuses on the medical cases of emergency situations, where it provides users with their current location, provides them with access to the list of nearby medical emergency clinics and hospitals information and location that offer available emergency services and allows them to filter out destinations based on the nature of those said hospitals and clinics ( whether its private or public ). The suggested application will also give users the option to request an ambulance through a list of very well-known and reputable hospitals hotlines around Alexandria. Suggested smartphone software application will adopt simplicity and understandability, as we understand that during medical emergency situations, a straight forward and simple approach is the most practical approach to gain the users trust and dependability.</p>
